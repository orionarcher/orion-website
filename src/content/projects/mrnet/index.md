mrnet is a [chemically consistent graph archicture](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2021/sc/d0sc05647b#!divAbstract) aimed at understanding the incredibly complex phenomenom in the battery solid-electrolyte interphase. I am contributing a module to [mrnet](https://github.com/materialsproject/mrnet) that will make help speed up concerted reaction identification by leveraging GPUs.
